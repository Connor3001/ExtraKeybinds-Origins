[Mod requires Origins, Fabric, and Fabric API]

 PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL THIS MOD ON A SERVER. Install it only on your client side, it will still work on servers, even if it is not installed on the server side

This mod adds a bunch of new keybinds to origins, so you can make and use datapacks with more than 2 keybinded powers!

I may not update this for versions of Origins past 0.7.0, but as far as I know the mod should work with future versions

names of keybinds for datapack creators:

1 - Primary: key.origins.primary_active
2 - Seconary: key.origins.secondary_active
3 - Ternary: key.origins.ternary_active
4 - Quaternary: key.origins.quaternary_active
5 - Quinary: key.origins.quinary_active
6 - Senary: key.origins.senary_active
7 - Septenary: key.origins.septenary_active
8 - Octonary: key.origins.octonary_active
9 - Nonary: key.origins.nonary_active
10 - Denary: key.origins.denary_active
